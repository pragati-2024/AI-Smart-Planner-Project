# AI Smart Daily Planner 🧠📅

## 📌 Project Overview

AI Smart Daily Planner is an intelligent web-based application designed to help users plan their daily activities in a smart and efficient way. Unlike a normal to-do list, this planner uses AI-based logic to automatically organize tasks based on priority, available time, and productivity patterns.

The main goals of this project are:

* Improve time management
* Increase daily productivity
* Provide smart task planning suggestions

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In today’s busy lifestyle, students and working professionals often struggle to manage their daily tasks effectively. Manual planning is time-consuming and often leads to missed deadlines or unfinished important work.

The AI Smart Daily Planner addresses this problem by:

The AI logic analyzes these inputs and generates an optimized daily schedule.

Example:

* High priority tasks → Morning (high focus time)
* Medium priority tasks → Afternoon
* Low priority tasks → Evening
